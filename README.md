# `protoc-gen-star` Typescript Language

Package pgsts contains Typescript specific helpers for use with PG* based protoc-plugins.

It is directly copied from [`lang/go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-star@v0.6.0/lang/go) and then modified. It may not be completely migrated and some Go specific language features may still exist.
